Next.js 15 & React - The Complete Guide

##### What is NextJS

Next.js is a React framework that makes building full-stack apps easier. While React is just a front-end library, Next.js adds powerful features like server-side rendering, data fetching, authentication, and form handling.

##### Key Features & Benefits Of NextJS

It makes data fetching, form handling, and routing easier and more secure. Routes are created automatically through the file system (no extra setup needed). Plus, Next.js renders pages on the server, so content loads faster and is better for SEO. That’s why it’s widely used for building complex React apps.

#### Pages Router vs App Router - One Framework, Two Approaches

Next.js offers two ways of building apps: Pages Router and App Router.

- The Pages Router is the older, stable approach that has been used for years. It’s reliable and still widely used in many projects.

- The App Router, introduced in Next.js 13, is the newer, modern approach. It supports features like React Server Components and Server Actions, which make apps more powerful and efficient.
